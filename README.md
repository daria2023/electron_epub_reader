# Epub reader
This app is using electron to build an epub reader, which can run locally. Bur i haven't using any fiddle or electron-builder to build an exe file so if anyone is interested to it, you can just leave a message and build it someday.
There are still something else i'm fixing:
- the port occupied problem, especially for developers who is running lots of serve locally;
- the fetched images should be cleared after the chapter has read;
- more fonts and style can be provided;
- more theme can be provided, i set it dark only because it fits my general pc theme.

待完成：
- 可能存在的端口占用问题；
- 本章阅读完后清理加载的图片；
- 更多字体、样式和主题提供；
