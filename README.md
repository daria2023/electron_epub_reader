# Epub reader
This app is using electron to build an epub reader, which can run locally. Bur i haven't using any fiddle or electron-builder to build an exe file so if anyone is interested to it, you can just leave a message and build it someday.
There are still something else i'm fixing:
- ~~the port occupied problem, especially for developers who is running lots of serve locally~~;
- the fetched images should be cleared after the chapter has read;
- ~~more fonts and style can be provided~~(enough for me for chinese fonts);
- ~~more theme can be provided, I set it to dark only because it fits my general pc theme~~(support light and dark themes now!).
- Open note-list so that the user can save the parts they like locally!
- release the first version exe package ;
待完成：
- ~~可能存在的端口占用问题~~；
- 本章阅读完后清理加载的图片；
- ~~更多字体、样式和主题提供~~；
- 开启保存笔记功能；
- 发布第一版Windows exe安装包；
